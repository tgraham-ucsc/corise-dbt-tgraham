### conversion rate

```The conversion rate is the number of conversions divided by the total number of visitors. For example, if an ecommerce site receives 200 visitors in a month and has 50 sales, the conversion rate would be 50 divided by 200, or 25%.
```

(2) Weâ€™re getting really excited about dbt macros after learning more about them and want to apply them to improve our dbt project. 

Create a macro to simplify part of a model(s). Think about what would improve the usability or modularity of your code by applying a macro. Large case statements, or blocks of SQL that are often repeated make great candidates. Document the macro(s) using a .yml file in the macros directory.
Note: One potential macro in our data set is aggregating event types per session. Start here as your first macro and add other macros if you want to go further.
